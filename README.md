Automated trading is a risky activity. There is no guarantee of profit, and you could lose all of your investment. You should only trade with money that you can afford to lose. You should also carefully research any trading bot before using it.

I am not responsible for any loss due to the use of the bot. The bot is provided as-is, and I make no guarantees about its performance. You are solely responsible for any losses that you incur while using the bot.

Here are some of the risks associated with automated trading:
- Market volatility: The market can be volatile, and prices can fluctuate rapidly. This can lead to losses, even for well-designed trading bots.
- Technical errors: Trading bots are software programs, and they are susceptible to technical errors. These errors can cause the bot to make incorrect trades, which can lead to losses.
- Market manipulation: Market manipulators can try to take advantage of automated trading bots. They may use spoofing or layering techniques to create false signals that the bot will follow.
- Cybersecurity risks: Automated trading bots can be hacked, which could lead to unauthorized access to your trading account and losses.
